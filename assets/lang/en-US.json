      "question": "How is the additional percentage calculated?",

    },
    "faq4": {
      "question": "How many years do you need to work to be able to collect the pension plan?",
      "answer": "Under the WorkQuest rules, anyone can open a private sector savings plan. After the first three years, you will be able to receive 100 % of the accumulated funds.\nYou can keep accumulating funds for another year, or you can withdraw all funds to your portfolio."
    },
    "faq5": {
      "question": "What is a good pension?",
      "answer": "What amount is recommended for a good pension? Some counselors recommend saving 10 times the average wage during your working life at the time of retirement. So, if your average salary is $ 30,000, your pension savings goal should be about $300,000. Another good tip is that you should save 12.5% of your monthly salary."
    },
    "faq6": {
      "question": "Is the monthly pension taxable?",
      "answer": "The payment of the monthly pension is almost always considered a taxable income, and you will need to ensure that you have an adequate withholding tax on pension payments to meet the requirements of the tax administration"
    },
    "faq7": {

    },
    "faq8": {
      "question": "Can I cancel my pension and get the money?",
      "answer": "If you withdraw after the minimum of 3 years or on the day of the annual renewal, you will receive all the money you have already paid. If you decide to cancel later, you will not be able to receive a refund of your payments until the end of the extended period (usually 1 year)."
    },
    "faq9": {
      "question": "Can I collect my pension and continue working?",

      "answer": "Peer-to-peer (or P2P) insurance allows groups of people to provide insurance coverage to each other. Group fund members pool their money to insure the event of a risk affecting them.

      "question": "How does peer-to-peer insurance work?",
      "answer": "Request a peer review. In a peer review, your guarantee fund will discuss with other fund members the purpose of the service or therapies that may be medically necessary. You can upload to the chat all the documents and medical assessments necessary to prove the legality of your case, and then create a vote so that foundation members can make a decision. If the majority of the fund votes in favor, you will receive the payment in your wallet."

      "question": "How is the amount of the guarantee fund payment calculated?",
